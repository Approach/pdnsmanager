# PDNS Manager
[PDNS Manager](https://pdnsmanager.lmitsystems.de) is a simple yet powerful free administration tool for the
Powerdns authoritative nameserver. It supports master and native zones.
PNDS Manager was developed from scratch to achieve a user-friendly
and pretty looking interface.
PDNS Manager also features a powerful API to set records programatically.
This can be used e.g. for a dynamic DNS service, but also to obtain certificates
from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the dns-01 challenge.
PDNS Manager is written in PHP using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). The backend uses a MySQL/Maria DB or Postgres
database. The database is also used by Powerdns using the pdns-backend-mysql or
pdns-backend-pgsql backend.
